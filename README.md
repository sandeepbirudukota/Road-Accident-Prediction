# Road-Accident-Prediction

## Abstract : -

In this project, we try to overcome the problem of Road Traffic Accident(RTA) in USA by providing a tool to predict accident risk so that users can make informed decision about their traveling route. This application provides information about the severity of accident at selected location based on factors such as time and weather conditions. This application provides a dashboard for drivers where they can check the accident rate for a city. 
   
In our web application, we present analysis and visualization of the data. Besides, user can use the interactive dashboard in order to check and predict the probability of road accidents in their chosen routes.

The application uses machine learning models for predictions. User has to enter destination in the dashboard. Then the application will use Google API for route planning and a weather API for finding the weather conditions as well as date and time of the location.

## Dataset : 
The dataset consists of data captured by the US and State departments
of transportation, law enforcement agencies.
