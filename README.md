# Road-Accident-Prediction

## Abstract : -

In this project, we try to overcome the problem of Road Traffic Accident(RTA) in USA by providing a tool to predict accident risk so that users can make informed decision about their traveling route. This application provides information about the severity of accident at selected location based on factors such as time and weather conditions. This application provides a dashboard for drivers where they can check the accident severity for the given conditions of weather and amenities for the given  city. 
      
In our web application, we present analysis and visualization of the data. Besides, user can use the interactive dashboard in order to check and predict the probability of road accidents in their chosen routes.

Given the challenges of public safety today, research and analysis of real-time traffic and accident data to predict the risk of accidents is ubiquitous. Accident risk prediction can significantly improve public safety by warning the public. In this project, the probability of accident risk for a given case with selected conditions is predicted. Features like weather, traffic volume, road conditions, time of the day of previous accidents are utilized from the dataset. Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression,  Decision Tree, Neural Networks and random forest classifiers are used and their results are compared to provide the best prediction.

## Dataset : 
The dataset consists of data captured by the US and State departments
of transportation, law enforcement agencies.
